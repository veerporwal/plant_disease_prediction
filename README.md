# JugaadHacks Plant Disease Prediction

Welcome to JugaadHacks Plant Disease Prediction project! In this project, we have developed a machine learning model to predict plant diseases using images of plant leaves. This project aims to assist farmers in identifying and managing plant diseases early, thereby improving crop yield and reducing losses.

## Getting Started

To get started with using our plant disease prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Install the required dependencies:


4. Run the application:


5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can upload an image of a plant leaf to get predictions on whether the plant is healthy or infected with a disease. The model will classify the disease based on the image and provide information on the predicted disease.

## Model Information

The machine learning model used in this project is trained on a dataset of plant images with labels for different diseases. We have used the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the model.
